# Random Name Chooser

A graphical program in which users may input text into boxes, and press a button to randomly choose boxes until all are chosen. Users may also save their inputted text in order to load into the program again later.

## Installation

Download all files, and run the .jar file from the folder.
If the program does not run simply from opening the .jar file, type
java -jar NameChooser.jar in a terminal.

## Usage

I hope this program can be of help to people. I created this for one of my former teachers as a way for him to input names and select them at random as a part of his teaching, hence the name Random Name Chooser. This can be used for any random selecting with a visual component.
